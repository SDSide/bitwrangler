# bitwrangler



The bitwrangler engine.



### What is bitwrangler?



bitwrangler is a game engine with the goal of making games in the style of early MS-DOS games.



Is this a good idea? Nah.



Is it a fun novelty? Sure.



Will this actually be used for games? Unfortunately.



### How do I compile this?



* This uses the standard C++ library, along with SFML and any other libraries.



* SFML IS LINKED, though you will have to change the path as I installed it to my Documents folder.



* It's recommended to write your code in Visual Studio Code, just for the purpose of it being easier.



* I use the default GCC 14.2.0 compiler, compiling with G++. This is the compiler I recommend you use.



* To compile, use make. literally just run "make" in the terminal. the makefile will do all the heavy lifting as long as you've configured it right!



### Will you ever rewrite this in C with OpenGL or SDL or something?



I hope so.
